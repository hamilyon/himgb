0) vim improvements

    1) rebind LH back
    unmap L
    unmap H

    2) rebind WB back
    unmap W
    unmap B

    3) grep for "maven" "path" and others - so java will build automaticaly
ok

1)  try build simple web app
    1  no css, javascript, html only site. (throw away code)    1
    2  translate html to hamlet (may be more productive
        to work with hamlet directly)                           2
    3  write 'create' handler                                   1
    4  write 'done' handler                                     1
    5  write auth code (if needed)                              1
    6  deploy (static from warp, postgres db, todoapp.ru)       6




2)  learn haskell to the point it would be enough to replicate anonimous 
    vacancy page of headhunter
    1) 'frontik' part of stack - ensure it gets whole 'session', 'xmlback'
    'async' parts right - everyting else not nessesary. Proxying result as plus.
    Wai is plus.
        plan is this: 
        0  parse xml and write somethhing from xpath (hacks may be nessesary)
            0a) write test ensuring sesson gets parsed ok
            0b) write code that make test pass
        1  write async io in responce to http request
            1a) write sequential http request handler, with 2 sources
            1b) rewrite it using hardcore IORef's and ForkIo's
        2  compose whole thing
            2a) whole fuck of 'if's to ensire it fails when it fails
            2b) whole fuck of self.doc.puts - fuck fucking optimization - 
                we are writing throwaway code.
        3  glue code

    2) 'xslt' and 'fuchakabutsu' part of stack - optional, may be scripted
        0  script 'xslt' and 'fuchakabutsu' things - no need to write html!

    3) 'java' part of stack - use Persistent, try to use Monoids for any kind of
    'buiseness logic' and 'security' thing
        0  write tests for 'security' type of thing - shouldn't be so hard, 
            since vacancy employs much less security than anything else
        1  write test for 'buiseness logic' thing. No doubt, this is easy also.
            writing is on the wall, all anon users see vacancy not much
            differently (custom vacancies aside)
        2  write code that passes all above tests. 
        3  write whole fuckload of if's surrounding buiseness logic 
            ensuring happy path is happy
        4  write Persistent gets
            4a) schema
            4b) custom sql's

        5  generate xml
        6  write glue code

    4) try render page
        0  seven times as hard as previous standart tasks
